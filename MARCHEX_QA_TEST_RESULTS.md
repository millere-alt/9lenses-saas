## Test Results

### ✅ PASSED: Database Seeding
- [x] Organization created successfully in Cosmos DB
- [x] CEO user created with complete profile
- [x] 8 leadership team members created
- [x] Reporting structure established (all report to CEO except Chairman)
- [x] Sample assessment created with all participants
- [x] Proper role-based permissions assigned
- [x] Multi-tenant data isolation (organizationId as partition key)

### ❌ CRITICAL BLOCKER: Auth0 Configuration

**Issue**: Auth0 Callback URLs Not Configured

**Impact**: Login will fail immediately when attempted. Auth0 requires callback URLs to be whitelisted in the Auth0 dashboard.

**Required Action**:
1. Log into Auth0 Dashboard: https://manage.auth0.com
2. Navigate to Applications → 9Vectors Application
3. Add the following Allowed Callback URLs:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173,
   http://localhost:5173/callback,
   https://www.9vectors.com,
   https://www.9vectors.com/callback
   ```
4. Add the following Allowed Logout URLs:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173,
   https://www.9vectors.com
   ```
5. Add the following Allowed Web Origins:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173,
   https://www.9vectors.com
   ```
6. Save changes

**Status**: BLOCKED until configuration complete

### ⚠️ WARNING: Auth0 User Setup Required

**Issue**: CEO and leadership team users exist in Cosmos DB but have no Auth0 accounts

**Current State**:
- Users created with `auth0Id: null`
- Users created with `passwordHash: null`
- Backend sync endpoint `/api/auth/sync-auth0` will create/link accounts

**Expected Flow**:
1. CEO logs in via Auth0 for first time
2. Auth0 authenticates user (creates Auth0 account if needed)
3. Frontend receives Auth0 token and user info
4. Frontend calls `/api/auth/sync-auth0` with email and auth0Id
5. Backend finds existing user by email (marends@marchex.com)
6. Backend updates user with auth0Id
7. Backend generates JWT token for API access
8. User logged in successfully

**Manual Workaround**:
Since users don't have Auth0 accounts yet, they need to sign up first:
- CEO should use "Sign Up" instead of "Login" on first visit
- Use email: marends@marchex.com
- Auth0 will create account and link to existing Cosmos DB user
